#Web Ticker v1.1

##How to use

$('#webTicker').webTicker(settings);
//where webTicker is the id of the container you would like the ticker to run upon above function starts ticker rotating

$('#webTicker').webTicker('stop');
//stop the ticker from moving

$('#webTicker').webTicker('cont');
//continue ticker movement from where it was before (same settings as previously will be used)


## Settings - Optional

The settings at this point in time only include the speed of the ticker which is set by default to 0.05
Speed changes are relatively undested and setting it too fast might cause unexpected results

travelocity: 0.05

//width of the original container in which the ticker appears

.tickercontainer .mask
//can be used to achieve padding within the container

### Optional

.tickeroverlay-left , .tickeroverlay-right
